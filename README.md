### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral (Ph.D.) candidate at the [Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu/), where I am honored to be currently advised by [Dr. Bani K. Mallick](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~bmallick/) and co-advised by [Dr. Debdeep Pati](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~debdeep/Home.html). Before joining Texas A&M in 2023, I have completed my MSc. in Statistics from [Department of Statistics, University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html) in 2023, prior to which in 2021, I completed my BSc. in Statistics Hons. from [Department of Statistics, St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata](https://sxccal.edu/department-of-statistics). 

My research interest primarily lies in the broad avenue of Computational Statistics, which at present includes Bayesian Computation in the field of Machine Learning with applications extending out to the realm of Artificial Intelligence (Bayesian architecture in Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and much more). Along with this, my interests also encircles the usage of Bayesian paradigm in multidisciplinary problems. Application of Statistics in Combinatorial and Design Theory, Quantum Cryptography, Industry and Social Sciences, are also a part of my research involvements.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Bayesian Algorithms and related Computations in the realm of AI/ML.
